# co-rethink-document
A Document class for RethinkDB making use of generators.

I heavily borrowed from http://knowthen.com/episode-5-creating-models-in-koajs/.

See `examples/models.user.js` and `test/user.js` for an example of how powerful this tool already is.

## ES6
This package uses generators and classes, which are only available in [io.js](https://iojs.org/).

## Testing
Run the tests with `npm test`.
